What's this?
------------------

This is a simple [React js](https://reactjs.org/) chat app example using [PeerJS/Peer](https://peerjs.com/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Requirements
You need [Node](https://nodejs.org) (and npm - comes with your node installation) installed

### How to use?

In summary you need to run the server app, then the client. 

There are two folders in this repository, the server side (Node JS) called `server` and the client(React JS) called `client`
